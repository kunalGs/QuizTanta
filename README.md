** QUIZ TANTRA** is a web application for all kinds of users. Users can simply log in    to be able to create and join quizzes via sharing the quiz code. There might be lots of quiz generating applications, but the idea of creating a quiz and then taking it on the same platform and evaluating the students in such an amazingly easier way is quite innovative. 
 **
We have used a Node.js express and React framework to create this app.**The home page displays a user login using FireBase technology. We have used Socket.Io, a JavaScript library for real-time web applications to create this network system. We have used Materialize for UI, Redux for state management and MongoDB for database management. 
 
Also, for Source Control Management we have used GitHub. To automate the continuous integration we have used Jenkins. The frontend and backend of the system is containerized using docker whereas container orchestration is done using Docker-Compose. Ansible is used for continuous deployment. For monitoring, ELK stack is used.
